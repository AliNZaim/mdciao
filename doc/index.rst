``mdciao`` is a Python module that provides quick, "one-shot" command-line tools to analyze molecular simulation data using residue-residue distances. ``mdciao`` tries to automate as much as possible for non-experienced users while remaining highly customizable for advanced users, by exposing an API to construct your own analysis workflow.

Under the hood, the module `mdtraj <https://mdtraj.org/>`_ is doing most of the computation and handling of molecular information, using `BioPython <https://biopython.org/>`_ for sequence alignment, `pandas <pandas.pydata.org/>`_ for many table and IO related operations, and `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org.org>`_ for visualizaton. It tries to automatically use the

* `Ballesteros-Weinstein-Numbering (BW) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043947105800497>`_
* `Common G-alpha Numbering (CGN) <https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/CGN/faq.html>`_

consensus-nomenclature schemes by either using local files or on-the-fly lookups of the `GPRC.db <https://gpcrdb.org/>`_
and/or `<https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/CGN/>`_

Basic Principle
---------------

``mdciao``  takes the files typically generated by a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, i.e.

* topology files, like *prot.gro* or *prot.pdb*
* trajectory files, like *traj1.xtc*, *traj2.xtc*

and calculates the  time-traces of residue-residue distances, and from there, **contact frequencies** and **distance distributions**.

.. note::

 A note of caution regarding the above definitions for *contact* and *frequency*:

 * the kinetic information is averaged out. Contacts quickly breaking and forming and contacts that break (or form) only once **will have the same frequency** as long as the **fraction of total time** they are formed is the same. For analysis taking kinetics into account, use. e.g. `pyemma <http://mdtraj.org>`_.
 * The sharp, "distance-only" cutoff can sometimes over- or under-represent some interaction types. Modules like `get_contacts <https://github.com/getcontacts/getcontacts>`_ capture these interactions better, and have a ton of other features features.

 However, both these issues (if/when they arise) can be spotted easily by looking at the time-traces of said contacts and informed decisions can be made wrt to parameters like the cutt-off value, number of contacts displayed and many others.
