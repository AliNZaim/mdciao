API

The API is what you get to your Python scope upon importing ``mdciao``, .e.g.::

 import mdciao

The API has a :ref:`dedicated submodule <mdciao.cli>` to replicate the Command-Line-Interface, ``mdciao.cli`` and a
lot of other methods that expose useful functions to create your own workflows. The the :ref:`Jupyter Notebook Tutorial`
has some highlights and easy walkthroughs, while the :ref:`Jupyter Notebook Gallery` for some more fancy examples.
Check the :ref:`API Reference` page for the full API documentation.
