API
---

The API is what you get to your Python scope upon importing ``mdciao``, .e.g.::

 import mdciao

The API has a :ref:`dedicated submodule <mdciao.cli>` to replicate the Command-Line-Interface, ``mdciao.cli`` and a
lot of other methods that expose useful functions to create your own workflows. Check the :ref:`API Reference` page
for a comprehensive overview or the :ref:`Jupyter Notebook Tutorial` for some highlights and walkthroughs.

   Whereas the command-line-tools tend to be more stable, the API might experience some changes until
the first major release.
