CLI-Reference
=============
We refer to the command-line-tools collectively as the command-line-interface, or CLI. Their options go well beyond those shown in the :ref:`Basic-Usage`, as we saw in the :ref:`Highlights`. Use these pages (menu to the left) or the ``mdc_command.py -h`` syntax to get help. For an inline overview of all options and ready-to-use examples, give::

  mdc_examples.py

a try!
